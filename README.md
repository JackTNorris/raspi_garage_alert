Generate an alert when your garage door is left open

I was inspired by the work done by this guy: https://github.com/rllynch/pi_garage_alert, but I wanted to make pretty drastic changes and I thought it would be rude to so radically change someone's code in a fork.

Documentation can be found here: [Documentation on ReadtheDocs.io](https://raspi-garage-alert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

As of v0.3.0 it now works with MQTT and is useful for using with Home Assistant:
